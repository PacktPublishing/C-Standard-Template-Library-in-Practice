# C++ Standard Template Library in Practice [Video]
This is the code repository for [C++ Standard Template Library in Practice [Video]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/C-Standard-Template-Library-in-Practice), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. Fast, efficient, and flexible, it is used to solve many problems. In particular, it is the Standard Template Library (STL) that gives C++ its power. In this course, we show you how.
Using real-world examples, we focus on how STL handles and manipulates data. We examine containers and iterators, and how data can be transformed into meaningful information using algorithms. There is coverage of I/O streams, strings and numerical methods, and how performance can be optimized through careful consideration of memory allocation and manipulation. We also demonstrate how multitasking and shared data is handled through concurrency and parallelism classes and utilities.
By the end of the course, you will understand the newer aspects of C++ STL and will be able to overcome tasks that are time-consuming or would break your stride while developing.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To get the most out of the examples and development experience, it is recommended you to have a relatively newer development device with at least the following things:

CPU: 4 cores
Memory: 8 GB RAM
Disk space: 40 GB
The examples (with a few exceptions) have been designed to run on both macOS and Windows PC devices. To follow along you should have the following software installed:

PC: Visual Studio 2015 Community or better
macOS: XCode 8.x or better. Other software needed will be described as required.
